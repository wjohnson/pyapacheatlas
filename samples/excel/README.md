# Excel Samples for PyApacheAtlas

There are four key features of the PyApacheAtlas package with respect to the Excel frontend.

## Features and Samples
* **Bulk upload entities**
  * [Bulk Entities Excel Sample](./excel_bulk_entities_upload.py)
  * You want to dump entity information into excel and upload.
  * You want to provide some simple relationship mapping (e.g. the columns of a table).
  * Your entities may exist and you want them updated or they do not exist and you want them created.
* **Hive Bridge Style Table and Column Lineage**
  * [Custom Table and Column Lineage Excel Sample](./excel_custom_table_column_lineage.py)
  * You are willing to use a custom type to capture more data about lineage.
  * You are interested in capturing more complex column level lineage.
  * None of the entities you want to upload exist in your catalog.
* **Creating Custom DataSet Types**
  * [Custom Type Excel Sample](./excel_custom_type_and_entity_upload.py)
  * You have a custom dataset type you want to create with many attributes.
  * You want to upload an entity using that custom type as well.
* **Create Lineage Between Two Existing Entities**
  * [Update / Create Lineage Between Existing Entities](./excel_update_lineage_upload.py)
  * You have two existing entities (an input and output) but there is no lineage between them.
  * You want to create a "process entity" that represents the process that ties the two tables together.

Each sample linked above is stand alone and will create an excel spreadsheet with all of the data to be uploaded. It will then parse that spreadsheet and then upload to your data catalog.

I would strongly encourage you to run this in a dev / sandbox environment since it's a bit frustrating to find and delete the created entities.

## Requirements

* Follow the steps to install the latest version of PyApacheAtlas and its dependencies on the main ReadMe.
* You'll need a Service Principal (for Azure Data Catalog) with the Catalog Admin role.
* You'll need to set the following environment variables.

```
set TENANT_ID=YOUR_TENANT_ID
set CLIENT_ID=YOUR_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CLIENT_ID
set CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CLIENT_SECRET
set ENDPOINT_URL=https://YOURCATALOGNAME.catalog.babylon.azure.com/api/atlas/v2
```

## Deleting Demo Entities and Types

* You have to delete entities based on GUID and types can be deleted by name.
* If you're following along with the built-in demos, search for 'pyapacheatlas' to find the majority of the entities.
* To find the guid, select the asset from your search and grab the guid from the URL.

```
# Delete an Entity
client.delete_entity(guid=["myguid1","myguid2"])

# Delete a Type Definition
client.delete_type(name="mytypename")
```
